# AI-Powered Job Review Generator

## Description

This application leverages the power of OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o, combined with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create compelling and contextually relevant job reviews. It retrieves information from local documents to provide context to the LLMs, enabling them to generate more tailored and informative content.

## Features

*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Utilizes a local `project_data/` directory as a knowledge base. The system scans for `.txt` and `.md` files, vectorizes their content, and retrieves the most relevant chunks based on the job query.
*   **Two-Pass LLM Generation:**
    1.  **Drafting:** GPT-3.5-turbo generates an initial draft of the job review based on the user's query and the RAG context.
    2.  **Refinement:** GPT-4o reviews and refines the draft, enhancing its clarity, conciseness, grammar, and engagement.
*   **Flexible Document Handling:** Supports `.txt` and `.md` file types within the `project_data/` directory for the RAG system.
*   **Environment-Based Configuration:** Securely manages the OpenAI API key via environment variables.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # If you have a git repository, clone it. Otherwise, ensure you have the project files.
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd <project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    If you cloned a repository, you're likely already there. Otherwise, `cd` into the directory where you've saved these files.

3.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   On Linux/macOS:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows (Command Prompt):
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On Windows (PowerShell):
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Set up OpenAI API Key:**
    *   This project uses an `.env` file to manage the OpenAI API key, leveraging the `python-dotenv` library. This is the recommended way to handle your API key securely.
    *   An example file `.env.example` is provided. Copy it to create your own `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open the newly created `.env` file (e.g., with a text editor) and add your actual OpenAI API key:
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here" 
        ```
        Replace `"your_actual_api_key_here"` with your real API key.
    *   **Important:** The `.env` file contains sensitive information and is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. Do not remove it from `.gitignore`.
    *   (Alternative) While using a `.env` file is preferred, the application will still respect the `OPENAI_API_KEY` if it's set directly as an environment variable in your system (e.g., via `export` or `set`). However, the `.env` method takes precedence if the file exists and the variable is set within it, due to the `load_dotenv()` call in `app.py`.

2.  **Ensure API Access (OpenAI Account & Models):**
    Make sure your OpenAI account associated with the API key has sufficient credits and access to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4o` models.

## Usage

1.  **Populate `project_data/` Directory:**
    Create or copy relevant text (`.txt`) or markdown (`.md`) files into the `project_data/` directory. These files will serve as the knowledge base for the RAG system. Examples include:
    *   Company values and mission statements.
    *   Summaries of past projects.
    *   Descriptions of team skills and expertise.
    *   Existing job description templates or role outlines.

2.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the main script from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Job Query Customization:**
    Currently, the application uses a hardcoded job query within the `main()` function in `app.py`. To generate reviews for different roles or requirements, you will need to modify this query directly in the script:
    ```python
    # In app.py, inside the main() function:
    job_query = "Generate a review for a senior software engineer specializing in Python and cloud technologies, requiring at least 5 years of experience and strong communication skills."
    # Change the string above to your desired query.
    ```

## Running Tests

The project includes unit and integration tests to ensure its components function correctly.

1.  **Navigate to the Project Root Directory.**
2.  **Run the Tests:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies (including test-specific ones like `scipy` if used directly in tests, though it's in `requirements.txt`) are installed.
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -s tests
    ```
    This command will automatically discover and run all tests within the `tests` directory.
```
